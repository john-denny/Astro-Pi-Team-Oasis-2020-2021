# Fetch external data -----------------------------------------------------

# Write code in this file that fetches original/external data, processes and
# wrangles it, and saves it in the `data/` folder. The project dataset saved
# in the `data/` folder should only be relevant to the project at hand. Can
# be either one or more functions or is a script that can be called via `source()`.

# Load the main dataset and wrangle as necessary.
# project_data <- ...

# Data wrangling commands

# Save the dataset to the data/ folder.

# Will need to install devtools
# Uncomment to use this:
# devtools::use_data(project_data, overwrite = TRUE)

# Or base version (need to install the here package):
# save(project_data, file = here::here("data/project_data.rda"))
